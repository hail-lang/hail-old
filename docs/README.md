# hail
hail is a weakly statically-typed, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language that aims to be yet another successor to C.  It aims to provide the same advantages of C, such as extremely high performance and small executable size, but with a few more safeties to ensure that the program runs.

hail is manually memory managed, like C.  This means, unlike Rust or Go, memory management must be done by the user.
