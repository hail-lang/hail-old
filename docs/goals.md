# goals
hail should...

- Compile projects quickly.
- Be simple and straightforward, with syntax inspired by common technologies such as JavaScript, Rust and C.
- Have 0 runtime overhead.
- Be all in one, with a compiler, package manager and more built in.
- Be consistent.  There should only be one way to do things, and that one way should be efficient and reliable.
- Be backwards compatible (when hail is no longer in alpha/beta).  Breaking changes to language syntax or standard libraries should be a last resort.
- Have cool syntax.
