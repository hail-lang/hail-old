# The Language
Hail is a low-level, type-safe programming language.  By default, Hail doesn't manage memory.

It's designed to compete with other lower-level languages, such as C/C++, Jai, Odin, Rust and Zig.

# Goals
These are the goals which I intend to reach at one point with Hail.

- Compile applications "blazingly fast," without sacrificing stability or efficiency of the application.
- Generate small, portable executables.
- Be simple enough that a single person can know the entire language syntax & semantics by memory (excluding the standard libraries, as documentation will always be readily available for those).
